One of a few practice apps I made when I first started my iOS Development learning journey

This app I was so proud of because it was inspired during the time I was learning about data structures and algorithms in school. I took a lot of abstract concepts like DFS and BFS, graph traversal, arrays etc to build this on my own. Was a game I remember playing years before I made this but couldn't remember what it was called so I made something similar from memory.
I found this app along with one other hidden away in an old rusted flash drive. This was before I learned how to use git back in 2014 so I figured I'd upload it for memories sake and possibly to finish/update the app in the future. The app is currently functional after all these years however it didn't age well with the iOS sdk changes.
